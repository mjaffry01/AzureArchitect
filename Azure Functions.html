        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure. It allows developers to execute code triggered by events or schedules.</p>

        <h2>Case Study: Real-Time Data Processing with Azure Functions</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Fabrikam Industries collects sensor data from IoT devices deployed across multiple locations. They needed to process this data in real-time to monitor equipment performance and predict maintenance needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The existing infrastructure couldn't handle the real-time data influx, leading to delays in processing and analysis. Fabrikam required a scalable solution that could process data as it arrived without significant infrastructure investment.</p>
        
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>As the .NET Architect, you designed a solution using Azure Functions to process incoming data. The plan included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up Azure Event Hubs to ingest streaming data from IoT devices.</li>
            <li>Creating Azure Functions with Event Hub triggers to process data in real-time.</li>
            <li>Storing processed data in Azure Cosmos DB for fast retrieval and analysis.</li>
            <li>Implementing Azure Stream Analytics for real-time analytics and dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The team proceeded with the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Configured Azure Event Hubs to receive data from IoT devices.</li>
            <li>Developed Azure Functions in C# to process and transform the incoming data.</li>
            <li>Set up Azure Cosmos DB with appropriate data models for storage.</li>
            <li>Integrated Azure Stream Analytics to generate real-time insights and visualizations.</li>
            <li>Ensured end-to-end monitoring using Azure Monitor and Application Insights.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Post-implementation, Fabrikam achieved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> Data was processed within milliseconds of arrival.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The serverless architecture automatically scaled to handle data spikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Pay-per-use model reduced costs compared to maintaining dedicated servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Insights:</strong> Real-time analytics enabled proactive maintenance and reduced downtime by 25%.</li>
        </ul>
