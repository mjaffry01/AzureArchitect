        <h2>Case Study: Microservices Architecture with AKS</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Adventure Works, an e-commerce company, wanted to modernize their monolithic .NET application to improve deployment cycles and scalability.</p>
        
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The monolithic architecture made it difficult to release updates quickly and scale individual components based on demand. They needed a solution that allowed independent scaling and deployment of services.</p>
        
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>As the .NET Architect, you recommended adopting a microservices architecture using AKS. The strategy involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Breaking down the monolith into smaller, domain-specific microservices.</li>
            <li>Containerizing each microservice using Docker.</li>
            <li>Deploying and orchestrating containers with AKS.</li>
            <li>Implementing service discovery and load balancing within the cluster.</li>
            <li>Integrating Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The team executed the plan by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identifying and extracting microservices from the existing codebase.</li>
            <li>Creating Docker images for each microservice.</li>
            <li>Setting up an AKS cluster and deploying the containers.</li>
            <li>Configuring Kubernetes services and ingress controllers for traffic management.</li>
            <li>Establishing CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>After the transition, Adventure Works experienced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster Deployment:</strong> Deployment cycles reduced from weeks to hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Individual microservices scaled based on demand, improving resource utilization.</li>
            <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Isolated failures minimized the impact on the overall application.</li>
            <li><strong>Agility:</strong> Teams could work on different services simultaneously without affecting others.</li>
        </ul>
