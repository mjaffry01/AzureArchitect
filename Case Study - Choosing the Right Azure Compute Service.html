    <div class="section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Contoso Retail, a rapidly growing e-commerce company, is planning to modernize its online shopping platform. The existing platform is a monolithic ASP.NET application hosted on-premises. With increasing traffic and the need for faster feature deployment, Contoso wants to move to Azure and adopt a more scalable and flexible architecture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The primary challenges faced by Contoso are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The application must handle variable traffic loads, especially during peak shopping seasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment Speed:</strong> Faster deployment cycles to introduce new features and updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Optimize operational costs by paying for resources as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Management Overhead:</strong> Reduce the burden of infrastructure management.</li>
            <li><strong>Modernization:</strong> Transition from a monolithic to a microservices architecture over time.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Decision and Justification</h2>
        <p>After careful evaluation, Contoso decided to use <strong>Azure App Service</strong> as the primary hosting platform for their web application. The decision was based on the following reasons:</p>

        <h3>Why Azure App Service?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplicity and Ease of Use:</strong> Allowed for quick deployment without the need to manage infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Scaling:</strong> Built-in auto-scaling features met their scalability requirements during peak traffic periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Integration with Azure DevOps enabled faster deployment cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Authentication:</strong> Simplified user authentication with Azure AD and social identity providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reduced operational costs by minimizing management overhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Supports .NET Applications:</strong> Optimized for hosting ASP.NET Core applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Not the Other Options?</h3>

        <h4>Azure Functions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The application is a customer-facing web app, not an event-driven or background task.</li>
            <li>Azure Functions is better suited for microservices, background processing, or APIs, not monolithic web applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>While AKS offers powerful orchestration capabilities, it introduces unnecessary complexity for their current needs.</li>
            <li>Contoso's team lacks expertise in Kubernetes, leading to a steeper learning curve and higher management overhead.</li>
            <li>AKS is better suited for complex microservices architectures, which Contoso plans to adopt in the future.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Azure Virtual Machines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing VMs would significantly increase operational overhead.</li>
            <li>Scaling VMs requires more effort and doesn't provide the seamless auto-scaling of App Service.</li>
            <li>Contoso aims to reduce infrastructure management to focus on application development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Azure Container Instances (ACI)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>ACI is ideal for temporary or burst workloads, not for continuously running web applications.</li>
            <li>Lacks advanced scaling and load balancing features needed for a production web app.</li>
            <li>Not suitable for complex applications that require orchestration and persistent storage.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>The implementation plan for migrating to Azure App Service included:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Code Refactoring:</strong> Updating the application to target ASP.NET Core for better performance and compatibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</strong> Setting up Azure DevOps pipelines for automated builds and deployments.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Migration:</strong> Moving the on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Integration:</strong> Configuring Azure Active Directory for user authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Diagnostics:</strong> Implementing Application Insights for performance monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing and Validation:</strong> Conducting thorough testing in a staging environment before going live.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Post-migration, Contoso experienced significant improvements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> Seamless handling of traffic spikes during peak seasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Faster Deployment Cycles:</strong> Reduced deployment time from days to hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Lowered operational costs by 35% due to reduced infrastructure management.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> Application response times improved by 25%.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Development:</strong> Freed up resources to focus on developing new features.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
        <p>Contoso plans to gradually transition to a microservices architecture. In the future, they may incorporate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):</strong> For orchestrating microservices as the application evolves.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure Functions:</strong> For event-driven components or background processing tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure Container Instances (ACI):</strong> For testing new containerized services before moving them to AKS.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The decision to use Azure App Service provided Contoso Retail with a balanced solution that met their immediate needs for scalability, cost efficiency, and reduced management overhead. By carefully evaluating each option, they chose a service that aligned with their technical capabilities and business objectives, setting a solid foundation for future growth and modernization.</p>
