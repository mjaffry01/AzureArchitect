        <h2>Case Study: Migrating an On-Premises .NET Application to Azure App Service</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Contoso Retail, a mid-sized retail company, had an on-premises ASP.NET MVC application used for inventory management. The application faced scalability issues during peak shopping seasons, leading to slow performance and downtime.</p>
        
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Contoso needed a scalable, reliable solution without the overhead of managing infrastructure. They wanted to ensure high availability and improve performance while reducing operational costs.</p>
        
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>As the .NET Architect, you proposed migrating the application to Azure App Service. The migration plan included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refactoring the application to target .NET Core for cross-platform support.</li>
            <li>Using Azure App Service's auto-scaling feature to handle variable load.</li>
            <li>Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Azure DevOps.</li>
            <li>Integrating Azure SQL Database for the backend data store.</li>
            <li>Utilizing Azure Active Directory for secure authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The team executed the migration by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Updating the application codebase to .NET Core and testing locally.</li>
            <li>Setting up an Azure App Service instance with the required configurations.</li>
            <li>Establishing a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps for automated deployments.</li>
            <li>Migrating the database to Azure SQL Database with minimal downtime.</li>
            <li>Configuring Azure Monitor and Application Insights for monitoring and diagnostics.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Post-migration, Contoso experienced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> The application seamlessly scaled during high traffic periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> Page load times decreased by 40%.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> Operational costs reduced by 30% due to the elimination of on-premises servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Reliability:</strong> Achieved 99.9% uptime with Azure's high availability features.</li>
        </ul>
