        <h2>Case Study: Streamlining Batch Processing with Azure Container Instances</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Fabrikam Analytics, a data analytics company, processes large datasets for their clients. They have a .NET Core application that performs data transformation and analysis. The workload is highly variable, with peak processing occurring at the end of each month when clients submit their data.</p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The existing on-premises infrastructure was underutilized during off-peak times and struggled to handle peak workloads efficiently. Fabrikam needed a scalable, cost-effective solution to process data without maintaining idle infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>As the .NET Architect, you proposed using Azure Container Instances to run the data processing application. The plan included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Containerizing the .NET Core application using Docker.</li>
            <li>Using Azure Blob Storage to store input datasets and output results.</li>
            <li>Triggering container instances based on events or schedules.</li>
            <li>Automating deployment and execution using Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions.</li>
            <li>Monitoring and logging using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The team executed the plan by:</p>
        <ol>

            <li><strong>Storage Setup:</strong> Configured Azure Blob Storage containers for input and output data.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Developed an Azure Function that triggers the deployment of ACI instances when new data is uploaded.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Used Azure CLI and templates to automate the creation of container instances with the required resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Configured virtual network integration for secure access to resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Set up Azure Monitor alerts and dashboards to track performance and usage.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>After implementing the solution, Fabrikam achieved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reduced infrastructure costs by 50% due to pay-per-use billing.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Automatically handled peak workloads without manual intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Processing times decreased by 30% due to optimized resource allocation.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Eliminated the need to manage VMs or orchestrators.</li>
