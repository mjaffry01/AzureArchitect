        <h2>Case Study: Migrating Legacy .NET Applications to Azure Virtual Machines</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Contoso Ltd., a financial services company, has several legacy .NET applications running on Windows Server 2008 R2. These applications are critical for daily operations but are not compatible with newer operating systems without significant redevelopment.</p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The on-premises servers hosting these applications were reaching end-of-life, leading to increased maintenance costs and risks of hardware failure. Contoso needed a solution to migrate these applications to the cloud without modifying the existing codebase.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>As the .NET Architect, you proposed migrating the legacy applications to Azure Virtual Machines. The plan included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating Windows Server 2008 R2 VMs in Azure to maintain compatibility.</li>
            <li>Using Azure Site Recovery for seamless migration of on-premises VMs to Azure.</li>
            <li>Setting up Azure Virtual Network to securely connect VMs to on-premises resources.</li>
            <li>Implementing Azure Backup for data protection and disaster recovery.</li>
            <li>Utilizing Availability Sets to improve application uptime.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The team followed these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Evaluated the existing infrastructure and dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Set up Azure subscriptions, resource groups, and networking configurations.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration:</strong> Used Azure Site Recovery to replicate and migrate VMs to Azure.</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Updated configurations and connection strings to point to Azure resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Performed thorough testing to ensure applications functioned correctly in the new environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Go-Live:</strong> Switched over to the Azure-based VMs and decommissioned the on-premises servers.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>After migration, Contoso achieved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reduced capital expenditure on hardware and maintenance costs by 40%.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Reliability:</strong> Increased application uptime with Azure's infrastructure and Availability Sets.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Ability to scale resources up or down based on demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Continuity:</strong> Enhanced disaster recovery capabilities with Azure Backup and Site Recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Leveraged Azure's security features to protect applications and data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Migrating to Azure Virtual Machines allowed Contoso to extend the life of their legacy applications while benefiting from cloud infrastructure. This approach provided a cost-effective solution without the need for immediate application refactoring, giving the company time to plan for future modernization efforts.</p>
